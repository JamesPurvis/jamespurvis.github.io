									<p>I became interested with technology from a young age. Other children asked for toys or games for Christmas, but I vividly remember asking my parents for a copy of Windows 98. I spent the entire day installing it on the family computer. For years, I wanted to know everything about how computers worked. I researched everything I could about building them, upgrading them, and even the operating systems. As I got older, I found programming and it was an instant connection.</p>
									<p>I started in my tweens coding in Visual Basic 6, I knew from the minute I wrote my first "hello world" program that I wanted to be a software developer. Fueled by my love of video games, I used my knowledge to collaborate in open source projects with others. I taught myself Java, C#, the client server typology, how to work with sockets, and how to work with databases as I wrote game emulators to mimic my favorite online MMORPGs.</p>
									<p>After graduating from high school, I went through two years of college, but I had no guidance or mentorship, and ultimately I surcame to "imposter syndrome." Thinking software developers needed to be genuises and feeling inadequate, I started working in help desk tech support.</p>
									<p>I knew this was not my passion, and in 2019 I went back to school majoring in Computer Engineering. As of August '22, I have graduated with my Bachelor's Degree. Programming will always be a big part of  my life, and as someone without any "professional" experience I want to break into the software development industry.</p>
									<p>Even though I lack formal "professional" experience, I feel my passion, attitude, and problem solving skills defintely make up for that. Coding is not just a "job" for me, it is a hobby and a genuine interest.</p>
